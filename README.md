### Individual Level Predictive Modeling for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Outcome

I'm currently working on a personal project, focused on substance abuse treatment. I am working with a public dataset from the CTN (https://datashare.nida.nih.gov/study/nida-ctn-0027) that observed 1,200 patients in 8 treatment centers who are receiving treatment via Bupenorphene/Naltrexone and Methadone for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). I will observe their medication doses, urine tests and self reported drug use over their first thirty days of treatment. I will then build a transformer model, to predict if a patient will successfully complete treatment, by showing 4 consecutive clean urine tests at the end of 24 weeks of treatment. Since people who recover from substance abuse, due so in different trajectories, this creates a challenge and opportunity for precision medicine. Giving each patient a personalized risk score, will help them seek personalized care for more effective treatment, creating awareness and choice, that creates freedom from death and suffering.
