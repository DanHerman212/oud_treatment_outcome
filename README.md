# Predicting Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Treatment Outcome

### Predictive Modeling for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Outcome
July 2023 - September 2023

## Overview of the Opioid Crisis

There is an Opioid Crisis happening right now in the US, where nearly 107,000 Americans died from fatal overdose in 2021, which is 6 times greater than overdose death reported in 1999.  The major contributor to overdose death is Fentanyl, an artificially manufactured opioid that is 100 times stronger than morphine.  Fentanyl has become increasingly prevalent as a low cost alterntative in the illicit drug supply.  The DEA estimates that 6 out of 10 illicit pain pills are cut with Fentanyl.<br>
<br> The Opioid Crisis effects people across every demographic group, whether they are working class people or celebrities and professional athletes, we see people of varying background dying from overdose where Fentanyl is involved. </font>

## Project Introduction
<font size="4"> I recently completed a project, where I conducted several experiments with machine learning to predict treatment outcomes for patients who received Opioid Agonist treatment.  There were 2 goals for the project:<br>
 1) Analyze how predictions were made to identify risk signals in patients that lead to relapse.<br> 
2) Use predictions during treatment to assess risk signals for relapse and offer intervention to improve outcomes.

I used publicly available dataset [CTN00-27](https://datashare.nida.nih.gov/study/nida-ctn-0027) to capture clinical data to feed into a machine learning algorithm.  From this dataset, I captured clinical data for 1300 patients at 8 different centers, who received treatment for Opioid Use Disorder.
